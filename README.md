# ship-adventure

Using Monogame (an adaption of XNA), create boilerplate game where you can fly a ship through space and fire your laser canon.

Stretch goals will be to code the ability for the ship to visit other planets while avoiding obstacles and gather supplies along the way.

Following this video tutorial for boiler plate game setup and content:

# local developer environment

### Main Software List

- Visual Studio For Mac Community
- mgcb-editor-mac
- Visual Studio Code (mainly for odds and ends file extensions e.g. Markdown, XML, etc.)

### Notes

on visual studio macos community, things are feeling kind of buggy with the content manager.

the best way I found to add content is running this on the CLI:

`mgcb-editor`

https://docs.monogame.net/articles/tools/mgcb_editor.html

Then using that standalone window do all my content manipulation.

Will update important workflow things as I encounter them.

# ship-adventure
Using monogame (an adaption of XNA), create boilerplate ship-adventure game where you can fly a ship through space and fire your ships lazer canon. Stretch goals will be to code the ability for the ship to visit other planets while avoiding obsicales and gather supplies along the way.
